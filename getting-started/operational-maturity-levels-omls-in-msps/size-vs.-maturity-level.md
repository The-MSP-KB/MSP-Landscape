# Size vs. Maturity Level

It is a common misconception that larger MSPs have higher operational maturity levels. However, operational maturity has more to do with efficiency and effectiveness rather than company size. Both small and large MSPs can be found at various operational maturity levels, emphasizing the importance of focusing on operational improvement rather than simply growing the company.

By understanding the traits associated with each operational maturity level, MSPs can develop a roadmap for increasing their operational maturity and improving their overall performance in the industry.
