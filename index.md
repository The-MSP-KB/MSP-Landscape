## What are MSPs?

MSPs are companies that remotely manage a customer's IT infrastructure and/or end-user systems, typically on a subscription basis. They offer a range of IT services, including network management, security management, IT support, and more, allowing their clients to focus on their core business operations.

## Common Services Offered by MSPs

MSPs typically offer a variety of IT services to cater to their clients' diverse needs. Some common services include:

- **Network Management**: Monitoring, maintaining, and optimizing clients' networks to ensure seamless connectivity and performance.
- **Security Management**: Protecting clients' IT systems and data from security threats through proactive monitoring, threat detection, and incident response.
- **IT Support**: Providing end-user support and troubleshooting for hardware, software, and network issues.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Implementing data backup and recovery solutions to protect clients' critical information from loss or damage.
- **Cloud Services**: Helping clients manage and optimize their cloud infrastructure, applications, and services.

In addition to the common services mentioned above, MSPs may also offer strategic planning services that can be valuable for small to medium-sized businesses that may not have the resources to hire full-time executives for these roles. Some of these include:

- **vCIO Services**: External IT consultants offering strategic guidance, technology roadmaps, budgeting, vendor management, and compliance/risk management.
- **vCISO Services**: Overseeing information security programs, developing strategies, creating policies, incident response planning, security training, and conducting assessments/audits.

## Operational Maturity Levels in MSPs

The Service Leadership Operational Maturity Framework is designed to help Managed Service Providers (MSPs) evaluate and improve their operational efficiency, profitability, and client satisfaction. This framework consists of five levels of operational maturity, each tailored to the specific needs and challenges faced by MSPs at different stages of growth and development. By understanding and implementing the framework, MSPs can optimize their operations and achieve long-term success in the industry.

### MSP Size vs. Operational Maturity Level

It is a common misconception that larger MSPs have higher operational maturity levels. However, operational maturity has more to do with efficiency and effectiveness rather than company size. Both small and large MSPs can be found at various operational maturity levels, emphasizing the importance of focusing on operational improvement rather than simply growing the company.

By understanding the traits associated with each operational maturity level, MSPs can develop a roadmap for increasing their operational maturity and improving their overall performance in the industry.

#### Operational Maturity Level 1: Beginning MSPs

At Level 1, MSPs are characterized by low to negative financial performance and inconsistent service quality. Traits that support improvement at this level include:

- Implementing basic time tracking and project management systems
- Developing a basic understanding of pricing strategies and profit levers
- Establishing a foundational level of service delivery and customer support
- Creating a basic process for hiring, onboarding, and terminating employees

#### Operational Maturity Level 2: Emerging MSPs

MSPs at Level 2 exhibit low to negative financial performance and inconsistent service quality but have started to understand the basics of profit levers. Traits that support improvement at this level include:

- Implementing basic controls and operational processes
- Improving pricing strategies and understanding their impact on profitability
- Establishing forward planning and budgeting processes
- Aligning incentive compensation with operational goals

#### Operational Maturity Level 3: Scaling MSPs

Level 3 MSPs typically deliver median financial performance and service quality. Traits that support improvement at this level include:

- Implementing more advanced controls and operational processes
- Refining budget planning and attainment tracking processes
- Ensuring that incentive compensation is directly tied to operational goals
- Streamlining service delivery and enhancing customer support

#### Operational Maturity Level 4: Optimizing MSPs

At Level 4, MSPs demonstrate high financial and service quality performance. Traits that support improvement at this level include:

- Focusing on continuous improvement of operational processes and controls
- Utilizing advanced budgeting and forecasting techniques
- Leveraging incentive compensation plans tied to budget attainment
- Implementing advanced service delivery methods and technologies

#### Operational Maturity Level 5: Innovating MSPs

Level 5 MSPs are the highest performers in terms of financial performance and service quality. Traits that support improvement at this level include:

- Continuously innovating and expanding service offerings
- Developing strategic partnerships with vendors and other industry players
- Fostering a culture of innovation and growth within the organization
- Utilizing advanced data analytics and business intelligence to drive decision-making

### MSPs of All Sizes and OMLs: Adapting Best Practices and Tooling

Smaller MSPs and those with varying operational maturity levels can benefit from adopting industry best practices and leveraging the right tools for their specific needs. Understanding how these practices and tools can organically help MSPs scale their business growth and development without the need for heavy reliance on human resources:

- **Process-driven improvements**: When MSPs adopt best practices and tools that are tailored to their needs, they can naturally improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness, leading to higher OMLs without necessarily following a strict, formalized approach.
- **Tailored tool adoption**: By choosing tools that align with their specific requirements and integrating them effectively, MSPs can streamline their processes and better manage their IT environments, which can contribute to higher OMLs.

### Beyond OMLs – the Broader Success Factors of MSPs

OMLs offer a vital framework for MSPs to measure their financial and operational efficiency, but it is important to acknowledge there's other contributors to a successful MSP business. By also focusing on these additional factors, MSPs create a well-rounded, thriving business that achieves long-term success beyond the financials.

#### Collaborative Networking

- Engaging with industry peers through forums and online peer groups.
- Participating in real-time chat communities to share insights and experiences.
- Building strategic partnerships within the MSP ecosystem to drive mutual growth.

#### Digital Presence and Branding

- Establishing a strong online presence through social media platforms and professional networks, such as LinkedIn.
- Building brand recognition and trust through thought leadership and relevant content.
- Leveraging targeted marketing strategies to reach potential clients and showcase the MSP’s expertise.

#### Commitment to Learning and Innovation

- Staying informed on the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies.
- Investing in employee development through certifications, training, and workshops.
- Encouraging a culture of innovation, embracing change, and continuous improvement
