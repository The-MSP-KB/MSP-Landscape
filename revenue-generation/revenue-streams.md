# Revenue Streams

A successful MSP business leverages a mix of recurring, one-time, and complementary revenue streams to ensure financial stability and growth. By diversifying their income sources, they can adapt to market changes and capitalize on new opportunities. This section outlines various revenue streams that MSPs incorporate into their business models. For most MSPs, the recurring revenue is their preferred model.

**Recurring Revenue**

* Monthly or annual fees from clients for ongoing IT services, such as network management, security management, and IT support.
* Subscription-based pricing for cloud services, software, and infrastructure management
* Service level agreements (SLAs) that outline the scope of services and associated fees

**One-time Revenue**

* Fees for one-time projects, such as system installations, migrations, or custom software development
* Revenue from consulting services, including IT assessments, strategy development, and technology roadmaps.
* Commissions or referral fees from hardware and software vendors when selling products to clients

**Complementary Revenue Streams**

* Value-added reselling (VAR) opportunities, where MSPs bundle their services with third-party products to offer clients a more comprehensive solution.
* Professional services, such as IT strategy consulting, project management, or business continuity planning
* Managed security services, including vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and incident response.
* Training and educational services, such as workshops, webinars, or certification courses for clientsâ€™ staff
