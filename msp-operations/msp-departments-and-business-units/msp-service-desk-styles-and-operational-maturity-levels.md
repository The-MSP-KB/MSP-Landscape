# MSP Service Desk Styles and Operational Maturity Levels

MSP service desks play a critical role in delivering efficient and reliable support to clients. There are various styles of service desks, each with its unique approach to handling service requests and managing resources. This section explores different service desk styles and their corresponding levels of operational maturity.

This document contains a general overview of different styles MSPs can adopt. While there are variations and combinations of these styles, the most common MSP service desk types can be broadly categorized as follows:

1. **Tiered Service Desk**: In a tiered service desk model, support is divided into different levels, with each level responsible for handling specific types of issues. Typically, Level 1 support handles basic troubleshooting and issue resolution, while more complex problems are escalated to higher levels. This model allows for efficient allocation of resources and ensures that technicians with the appropriate expertise are assigned to relevant tasks.
2. **Swarming Service Desk**: The swarming model is a collaborative approach to issue resolution, where technicians from various disciplines work together to solve problems without the need for formal escalation. This model can lead to faster resolution times and improved knowledge sharing among team members. However, it may require a higher level of coordination and communication to function effectively.
3. **Dedicated Support Team**: In this model, MSPs assign dedicated support teams to specific clients, ensuring that technicians are familiar with the client's environment and requirements. This approach can improve the overall quality of service and foster stronger client relationships, but it may also result in higher operational costs due to the need for specialized resources. This style is also called "Pod-Style".
4. **Shared Service Desk**: A shared service desk is a centralized support model where multiple clients' needs are addressed by a single team of technicians. This model can offer cost savings and improved resource utilization for MSPs but may lead to less personalized service for clients.

MSPs can choose from these service desk types or adopt a hybrid approach, combining elements from different models to best suit their clients' needs and their operational goals. Ultimately, the most effective MSP service desk model will depend on factors such as client expectations, available resources, and the MSP's overall strategy for growth and operational maturity.

Within these styles there are several operational differences that define how the service desk works at a tactical level as well, where the primary categories are:

#### 1. Service Desk with Dispatchers

In this style, MSPs utilize dedicated dispatchers to manage incoming service requests, assign tasks to technicians, and oversee the overall service delivery process. This model allows for improved coordination and efficient allocation of resources, leading to higher operational maturity. Dispatchers can ensure that tasks are assigned according to technicians' skills, availability, and workload, enabling timely resolution of issues and adherence to SLAs (Service Level Agreements).

#### 2. Service Desk without Dispatchers

In contrast, a service desk without dispatchers relies on technicians to self-assign tasks and manage their workload independently. While this model can offer flexibility and autonomy, it may lead to suboptimal resource allocation, longer response times, and potential breaches of SLAs. This approach is generally associated with lower operational maturity, as there is less centralized control over service delivery processes.

#### 3. Service Desk with SLAs

Service desks that operate under SLAs have predefined response and resolution timeframes based on the severity and priority of service requests. Implementing SLAs can help MSPs maintain a high level of operational maturity by setting clear expectations for service delivery and ensuring that client issues are addressed promptly. This approach also allows MSPs to measure their performance against industry standards and make data-driven improvements to their processes.

#### 4. Service Desk without SLAs

Operating a service desk without SLAs can hinder an MSP's ability to achieve higher operational maturity. Without clearly defined expectations for response and resolution times, it becomes challenging to measure performance and ensure consistent service quality. MSPs without SLAs may struggle to prioritize tasks effectively, leading to inefficiencies and potential client dissatisfaction.

MSPs should carefully consider their service desk style and adopt practices that promote higher operational maturity. Incorporating dispatchers and implementing SLAs can enhance resource allocation, streamline processes, and ensure timely resolution of service requests. By continuously evaluating and refining their service desk operations, MSPs can deliver exceptional support and build lasting relationships with their clients.
