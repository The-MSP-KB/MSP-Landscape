# Requesting MDFs from Vendors: Best Practices

### **Research Vendor MDF Programs**

* Familiarize yourself with each vendor's MDF program requirements, application process, and reporting expectations.
* Review the vendor's MDF program documentation and attend any available training or webinars to gain a clear understanding of their process.

### **Develop a Marketing Plan**

* Create a detailed marketing plan outlining the objectives, target audience, tactics, timeline, and expected results of the campaign.
* Clearly align the marketing plan with the vendor's products, services, or solutions.
* Provide a realistic budget and breakdown of the marketing expenses that you plan to incur during the campaign.

### **Prepare a Compelling MDF Proposal**

* Present your marketing plan in a clear and concise proposal, demonstrating the value of the campaign for both your MSP and the vendor.
* Highlight the expected return on investment (ROI) and key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure the success of the campaign.
* Emphasize how the campaign will drive demand for the vendor's products or services and strengthen your partnership.

### **Submit the MDF Request**

* Follow the vendor's MDF request submission process, ensuring that all required documentation and information is provided.
* Submit the request within the vendor's specified time frame, and keep track of any deadlines for reporting or reimbursement claims.

### **Track Campaign Performance and Report Results**

* Monitor the performance of the marketing campaign, tracking the KPIs and ROI as outlined in your proposal.
* Regularly communicate the progress of the campaign to your vendor contact, providing updates and addressing any concerns.
* Complete any required post-campaign reporting, including proof of performance and expense documentation, to ensure timely reimbursement and compliance with the vendor's MDF program requirements.
